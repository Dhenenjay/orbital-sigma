# Domain-Specific Time Windows for GEE Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented domain-specific time windows for fetching embeddings from Google Earth Engine. The system now optimizes satellite data collection periods based on domain characteristics, improving data quality and reducing unnecessary processing.

## Key Components Added

### 1. **time_windows.json** Configuration
- Comprehensive configuration for temporal observation windows
- Domain-specific settings for 8 domains (port, farm, mine, energy, urban, forest, water, default)
- Regional adjustments for hemisphere-specific variations
- Cloud filtering thresholds per domain
- Aggregation methods optimized for each use case

### 2. **time_window_manager.py** Module
Core functionality for managing temporal windows:
- `TimeWindowManager` class for domain-specific temporal filtering
- Automatic hemisphere detection and adjustment
- Functions:
  - `get_time_windows()`: Get optimal observation periods
  - `get_priority_window()`: Get most important observation period
  - `apply_temporal_filter()`: Apply to GEE ImageCollection
  - `create_composite()`: Create domain-optimized composites
  - `get_aggregation_method()`: Get best aggregation for domain

### 3. **Enhanced routes_alphaearth.py**
Modified to use domain-specific time windows:
- Auto-detects domain from AOI identifier
- Applies appropriate temporal filtering
- Uses domain-specific aggregation (mean, median, max, min)
- Stores time window metadata with embeddings

### 4. **routes_time_windows.py** API Endpoints
New endpoints for time window management:
- `GET /time-windows/info/{domain}`: Get time configuration for domain
- `GET /time-windows/compare`: Compare windows across domains
- `GET /time-windows/aoi/{aoi_id}`: Get windows for specific AOI
- `GET /time-windows/calendar/{year}`: Get observation calendar
- `GET /time-windows/optimize`: Optimize collection schedule

## Domain-Specific Time Windows

- **Update frequency**: Monthly

### Agricultural/Farm
- **Window**: Growing season (Apr-Sep in Northern Hemisphere)
- **Priority**: June-August (peak vegetation)
- **Aggregation**: Max/Greenest (vegetation peak)
- **Cloud threshold**: 20% (need clear observations)
- **Regional adjustments**: 
  - Northern: Apr-Sep

## Aggregation Methods

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Mean | Average all observations | General monitoring |
| Median | Middle value, reduces outliers | Ports, energy |
| Max | Maximum values | Peak vegetation |
| Min | Minimum values | Bare earth, water |
| Greenest | Highest NDVI | Agriculture, forests |
| Clearest | Least cloudy | Mining operations |
